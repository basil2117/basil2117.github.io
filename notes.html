  <h1>NOTES</h1>
  <h2>5/4/2015</h2>
  <p>Its the night before closing. The appointment is tommorow at the bank, 1pm. Krisitin confirmed tonight the replaced the pipes they needed to, and the dishwasher is working. I think
  the electric is set to start up. I still need to call Cox to get the internet, and im assuming the city for the warter, but I can ask Carmen tommorow at Cinco de Mayo. Im so excited, I
  cant wait to get to painting and getting moved in. I plan to look around again tommorrow, maybe take my matress over. Then Tuesday I want to go look at paint colors, maybe even start. I want 
  to use this to document the process, and also get some html practice. Good stuff happening. </p>
